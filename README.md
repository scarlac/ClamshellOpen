ClamshellOpen
=============

App to allow running your laptop in clamshell mode with an open lid for Lion (10.7) and Mountain Lion (only 10.8.0 - 10.8.2).

Known bug: As of OS X update 10.8.3 (released 15th of March), this app no longer works.
The reason is the app exploited a bug in OS X which has been fixed by Apple in 10.8.3.

I have no planned updates that could make it work again. Sorry.
